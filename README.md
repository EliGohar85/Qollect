## Why Qollect?

Qollect removes the hassle of hunting through your Qlik app to find object definitions or chart metadata. It's perfect for:

- **Documentation & Governance** – Create quick snapshots to support audits, doc updates, or team handoffs.  
- **Development & Impact Analysis** – Check where things are used before making changes; find unused or duplicated objects.  
- **Onboarding & Collaboration** – Share a clear, structured overview of your app with new team members or stakeholders.

## Features

- Collects key Qlik app metadata components — dimensions, measures, charts, and sheets — into a structured format.  
- **One-click** metadata collection inside your Qlik Sense app.  
- Clean, minimal output — ideal for sharing, reviewing, or maintaining documentation.
